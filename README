ColourSwift AVDatabase 

Overview 

The ColourSwift AVDatabase repository contains the open virus-definition database and supporting binaries used by the ColourSwift AV+ Engine, the offline antivirus engine powering CS Secure Files and future ColourSwift security products. 

This repository exists to distribute verified definition updates and public releases from the official ColourSwift website. 

 

Repository Structure 

defs.vxpack 

Encrypted virus-definition file. Contains curated metadata, hash records, and heuristic rules used by the ColourSwift AV+ Engine to identify and classify threats. 

defs_key.bin 

Encrypted key file used internally by the engine to decrypt and authenticate the contents of defs.vxpack. This file is unique to the engine and cannot be used independently. 

/releases/ 

Contains signed APK builds of ColourSwift Secure Files for manual download. Builds are organised by architecture (for example, arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, or x86_64). 

 

Purpose 

The virus database and key binary together form the definition core of the ColourSwift AV+ Engine. 

They enable: 

Offline detection through hash, pattern, and heuristic scanning  

Secure verification of database integrity before load  

Local updates distributed through the official ColourSwift release channel 

Both files are encrypted for safe integration within ColourSwift applications.
